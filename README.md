# E36 Brake Force Display (BFD) (Not for road use)
Small arduino project to retrofit a BFD function (as known from E90) to the old E-Series. Please note that you will only use this function on closed tracks and not on road vehicles. In most countries it is illegal to modify safety equipment such as the circuit of the brake lights in road traffic.


## Idea
Modern vehicles indicate the force of braking via the brake lights. A two-stage approach is often followed: First, the brake lights illuminate normally and in the event of an emergency stop, the brake lights start flashing to indicate an emergency stop to the vehicle behind. It has been established, for example, in the E85 and E92 at BMW. To be able to retrofit this function, I wrote a script for the Arduino Uno and built a small circuit which allows to be built into the existing circuit.
